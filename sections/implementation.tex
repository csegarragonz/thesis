\chapter{Implementation} \label{chap:implementation}
% TODO: include code listings in this section!!
% TODO: Add appendix with all docker deployment files.

The aim of this chapter is to present the implementation details of \projName.
Each explanation is accompanied, when required, by code snippets to further illustrate the rationale behind our design choices.
The implementation we will cover is the one the results presented in Chapter \ref{chap:evaluation} are based on.
As a consequence, and in order to stress-test \projName, we replace real sensors with synthetic data generators.
Additionally, all components are packaged in Docker containers so that a large fleet of clients concurrently using our system can be replicated.
In \S\ref{sec:server-implementation} and \S\ref{sec:client-implementation} we cover the implementation details of the server-side and the client-side component respectively.
Re-using Docker-speciphic nomenclature, we will there refer to functionalities packaged in a container as services.
A collection of services makes up one component.
Lastly, in \S\ref{sec:deployment} we cover how we establish the client cluster and deploy hundreds of fake users.
Furthermore, in Appendix REF, we attach all the Docker configuration scripts together with the main source code. %TODO: appendix!!
